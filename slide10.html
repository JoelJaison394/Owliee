                    <br>

                    We were six in number. Four were girls and the rest two were boys. Every summer holidays<br>
we gather in grandpa&#39;s house to enjoy our vacation.<br>
Avinash, the eldest brother of our cousins gang always have new interesting ideas for every
summer holidays.<br>
Once, on a summer vacation, we six were watching a movie in the television. Then my small
aunt brought a packet of mixture and we were fighting for it. Suddenly Avinash brother
shouted &quot;I&#39;ve an idea... Let&#39;s go to the Nutmeg tree, and play a game&quot;. We agreed.<br>
We rushed to that tall and old Nutmeg tree.<br>
Avinash brother said; &quot;Let&#39;s make a house under this tree??&quot; We all were so excited.<br>
He started ordering...<br>
<br>
&quot;Saanii, do you have some unwanted sarees or shawls in your house?? Then bring it fast.&quot;
&quot;Alku, you want to help me to build roads and bridges.&quot;<br>
&quot;Namii and Anu go and find some sacks. And also bring some plates and glasses from the
house.&quot;<br>
A little time later everything was set as he ordered. It was time to make the house. The
Nutmeg tree was so big and had a lot of branches.<br>
With the old saree brought by Saanii, Avinash brother and Alku started to seperate rooms for
each member. The house even had a bathroom. With that time Anu and me floored with
sacks. There were special shelves in the branches to keep the plates and glasses. Finally
the house was covered with palm leaves.<br>
To enter into the house one should walk over a bridge. The bridge was made of Areca tree&#39;s
trunk.<br>
Avinash brother narrated a new story and our game is to act that story.
&quot;The story is about a family that live in a jungle. Each family member have their own jobs.<br>
But Anna the smallest one in the family is provided education. Early morning, the girls of the
family will take their things and go to the nearby town to sell their products.&quot;
&quot;Anu is excellent in making jewelleries with flowers. Saanii will sell her superfinished dishes
made of clay. Namii&#39;s duty is to sell Mangoes brought from the forest. Anna will be in the
school. At that time, the boys will work in the fields and look after the forest.&quot;
So that was the story. Next step was to play it.<br>
<br>
We acted like sleeping in our own rooms. Early morning, Avinash brother did a mimicry of
the rooster crows... and we all wake up. Anu went to pick jasmine flowers, Saanii put all her
clay made dishes in a basket, and went to prepare food for the family. Namii went deep

inside jungle to collect different types of mangoes. Anna was getting ready for her school.
The boys were taking their cows to the fields.
<br>
A little time later, everyone gathered in the main hall for their breakfast. Saanii gave them
each a plate of mixture and a glass of Rasna. After having their meals, girls were set out for
their journey and boys to the fields.<br>
After sending Anna to the school, Anu went to the main market. We acted like wandering in
the streets selling our products. At that time boys acted like pulling weeds in the fields and
feeding their cows.<br>
Evening everyone came back to the palm thatched house and shared that day&#39;s experience.
Saanii was explaining how fastly her dishes were sold. Anu shared her new ideas of making
jewelleries. Namii was talking about the costomers&#39; reviews on our delicious priyoor
Mangoes.<br>
It was late evening and everyone gathered for their meals. Again Saanii gave each a plate of
mixture and a glass of Rasna. We enjoyed our meals.
At night, the boys pretended like catching fireflies and putting in a glass bottle so that Anna
could study at night. She teached us Basic English and how to write numbers.
After that, everyone went to sleep.<br>
<br>
That was the best summer vacation ever we had. Now we all are grown up... Rarely get time
to gather. But in this pandemic, we play online ludo and sometimes vedio call.<br>
