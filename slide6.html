                    <br>

                    Karthik was in the queue at the ticket counter. Every weekend he used to take his wife and
children to a movie. They were very fond of movies. Karthik&#39;s was a love marriage, so that
his wife&#39;s decision was final for him.  <br>
That day as he was waiting in the queue, he met an old friend &#39;Syam&#39;. Syam was unmarried,
happily living with his mother. The queue was long as it would take more than twenty
minutes to get to the counter. So they started talking about their past few years.
Syam was the only son of his mother. His father passed away at his very small age. So, his
mother was everything for him. After his father&#39;s death, mother struggled a lot to take care of
him.  <br> So he decided to dedicate his whole life to his mother. He shared it all with Karthik.
Hearing Syam&#39;s story, Karthik&#39;s mind went back to his childhood.
Whenever Karthik&#39;s father scolded him, mother acted as a wall and protected him from all
beats. She was always on his side. Without father&#39;s knowledge she used to give him money
to buy snacks on the way back home. His eyes shed tears as he remembered all these.
He shared it with Syam. &quot;Once I asked papa. My friends are going for a movie. Can I also go
with them? Please papa.&quot;  <br>
<br>
He angrily said to maa &quot;Look.Your Son wants to waste my money. He doesn&#39;t know its
value. It&#39;s all my hardwork.You are the only one who made him so bad.&quot; <br>
&quot;Papa didn&#39;t give me money. I cried all night. Next day morning, Maa secretly gave me some
money for the movie. I was so happy.&quot;
&quot;But poor Maa. Papa has already found out that his money was stolen and he was sure it
was Maa. He treated her so badly. That was not the first time. Whenever she takes money to
give me, he will somehow find it and beat her so badly.&quot;
Karthik was so sad as he shared all these.
He remembered. <br>
After his father&#39;s death, Karthik and his mother were all alone in their house. He used to take
her for movies that she enjoyed the most.
At that time Karthik fell in love with one of his colleagues &#39;Niya&#39; and they were happily
married. <br>
<br> After marriage, Karthik changed a lot. He was all under the control of his wife.
Niya always behaved rudely towards his Maa. But he couldn&#39;t help her. If he doesn&#39;t stand
by his wife&#39;s side, she would start an outbreak that will end up with a severe quarrel so that
she will take all her things and will go to her own house.  <br>
<br>
His Maa never wanted to create an unnecessary problem in their married life so she always
kept quiet and endured everything. <br>
<br>
At weekends his Maa wished to join them for the movie but Niya always refused to take her
along with them.
Sharing all these to Syam, his feelings for Maa increased. The queue was almost over and
next was Syam&#39;s turn. Syam took tickets for both him and his mother. That made Karthik too
think about it. He too took an extra ticket for his Maa.
Reaching home, he ran to his Maa, hugged her tightly and said &quot;Maa, I love you&quot;. Niya
looked at him in a different way. He announced loudly &quot;Today our Maa is also coming with
us for the movie&quot;. Niya&#39;s face went red. She grabbed his hands and moved to their bedroom. <br>
She started shouting. Karthik tried to cool her but Niya&#39;s sound became louder and louder.
Karthik lost his patience and bursted out. <br>
Now, Niya was a little frightened. She was watching Karthik shouting for the first time.
Karthik tried to make her understand how his Maa was important for him. Karthik asked her
to think if she was in Maa&#39;s place. <br>
&quot;Your boys too are growing up. They watch how you treat Maa. One day you will be in her
place, and you too will struggle&quot;.
Niya understood her fault. She went to Maa and hugged her. Tears were rolling down both of
their eyes. <br>
<br>
It was a Noon show. They got into the car and chased it to the theatre. The movie was about
to start and Karthik entered with a family pack of popcorn. They were all seated.
Throughout the movie Karthik&#39;s eyes were over his Maa enjoying the movie with great
happiness. <br>
He was seeing his Maa happy after a long time. He felt like heaven. <br>
