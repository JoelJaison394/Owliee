                    Fallen from heaven, <br>

                    I gave my love and peace, <br>

                    Now, <br>
                    I wander for peace, <br>
                    Love and a little care, <br>

                    I&#39;m a broken Angel. <br>

                    <b class="title">ONE ACT OF KINDNESS</b> <br> 
<br>
&#39;Misunderstandings lead to many problems. Sometimes that affects a life. One act of
kindness could change the complete lifestyle of many.&#39; <br>
That was her first day in the new school. Sira woke up early and got ready. Her mommy
always made delicious food that all of her friends loved the most.<br>
Within her thirteen years of age she had shifted her schools five times. Her daddy was a
manager at a private company and always got promotions and transfers which forced them
to shift their home frequently. Her mommy was a healthcare nurse and would always be
busy with her work. Sira was their only daughter.<br>
Shifting to a new school was always a difficult task for Sira. She struggled to make new
friends and also to adjust with the new school&#39;s rules and regulations. That fear always
haunted her.<br>
She entered the car with a very depressed mind. Mommy was in the front seat and as daddy
was driving to the school, Mommy turned back and advised her how to behave in her new
school. But her mind was always somewhere. As the car entered the school&#39;s courtyard,
Sira&#39;s heartbeat level increased. Her mind was not at all ready to accept her new school.
Her eyes were bulged out, lips shivering. Her face became pale as Mommy introduced Sira
to her new class teacher.<br>
<br>
Sira had a strange childhood. Born to busy parents, her whole life was with the housemaid
and her toys. She was not allowed to go out and play with other children in the flat. Mommy
and daddy would have gone to work when she woke up. When they return, she will be
asleep.<br>
As she grew up, she felt lonely. The only friends she had were her dolls. She started to chit-
chat with her dolls, watched TV together, played games and also slept together.
For the first time when she went to a school, she felt a little difficult to adjust with other
children there. She missed her dolls. But slowly she started enjoying her school life.
Again when she was forced to shift her school, it made it tough to forget her old school and
friends. Her strange behaviour made other children isolate her. From there was the
beginning of everything. She was always depressed and rarely made friends each and every
time when she moved to a new school. Even her teachers hated her behaviour and always
complained to her parents about it.<br>
<br>
Shifting to her fifth school, her mommy was totally hopeless that she would change. But a
miracle happened within two months.
All credits to her class teacher, Ritu mam. She always watched Sira being disturbed during
the class hours but never scolded or asked anything to her. In the staff room also the main

topic that all teachers wanted to discuss was her strange behaviour. Other teachers always
complained about her to Ritu mam.<br>
So she decided to talk personally to her. She wanted to get friendly to Sira and solve her
problems. Sira was good at drawing, writing and Comics creating. But she never got enough
encouragement from her family as they had no time to listen to her.
They had a special time to share everything. THE LUNCH BREAK. Sira would have her
lunch in the staff room with her dearest teacher. She loved sharing her mommy&#39;s delicious
dishes with her teacher.<br>
Ritu mam encouraged her talents, and participated in many competitions. She wanted to
make a change in Sira. None of her old teachers tried to understand and help her to get out
of her fears.<br>
They created a bond between them. With her One Act of Kindness Sira changed to a new
one. She started to mingle with other students and teachers, smiled and laughed a lot, and
made a big gang of friends.... She painted sketches and comics of her friends and made
them laugh....<br>
Sira shifted to her sixth school a year later. Ritu mam continued changing her students&#39; lives.<br>
She received &#39;THE BEST TEACHER AWARD &#39; for changing Sira.<br>
<br>
<br>
Life is an endless journey.<br>
Do good and take good.<br>
