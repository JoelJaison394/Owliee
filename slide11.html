                    <br>
                    Once my friends and I bunked our class and went for a film. The movie theatre was near to
                    our school.<br> We lied to our headmistress to buy some books and jumped out. I clearly don&#39;t
                    remember the movie. We used to bunk classes and go for movies. But should say, we
                    enjoyed it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Students were not allowed to wander in the street during class hours. If once caught by the
                    police, they will not let them home until their parents come. Still, taking the whole risk we
                    bunked our classes. At that time our heart beat rate would be at the peak point.<br>
                    That day.......We left the theatre after the movie with great happiness and saw 2 policemen
                    standing on the road. We were a little terrified. Then my friend Riya said that we could get
                    out through the back road. She knows all the pocket roads there.
                    We were for the first time through that road. The road was a little scary with large trees on
                    both sides.<br> There were no houses, no people, no traffic, complete silence!! We were four in
                    number holding hands and walking so fast. We didn&#39;t talk about anything. The three were a
                    bit scared. Our face started turning red with fear. The road seemed so long.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    Riya confidently led us.
                    After a while, an old man with a thick beard jumped before us and started saying something.
                    He was drunk. Now our leader Riya was a little scared. We hold our hands tightly.<br>
                    He was smelling old rum. We noded for whatever he said. A little time later, he took a pen
                    knife from his shirt&#39;s pocket. Riya screamed loudly and ran from there. Behind her were us
                    the three.<br>
                    
                    That was our last movie together. After that incident, we were no more CLASS BUNKERS .<br>
