                    <br>

                    Today is Tara&#39;s thirteenth birthday. But she was so unhappy. Usually on her birthday, all her
friends would come, many gifts and cakes....she loved it. <br> But this year......
Due to this pandemic, everything is ruined. No friends, no gifts, no cakes... It was her Dad
who planned everything for her birthday. This year too, he had an amazing plan. But he kept
it a secret to give her a surprise. <br>
It was a pleasant sunny Sunday morning. Early in the morning itself they watched holy mass
online on YouTube. After their breakfast, Mamma said; <br>
&quot;Tara, get ready soon... we leave in half an hour.&quot;
&quot;To where?&quot; asked Tara. <br>
&quot;Don&#39;t you know your grandpa is bedridden for the past few years and the Covid cases are
increasing day by day. If the situation gets more dangerous we can never go out of our
house. If that happens, maybe we can&#39;t go to see him anymore. So today is the best day.
The weather is also good. You get ready soon... Go&quot; <br>
&quot;But Mom Today is my birthday. You didn&#39;t even wish me.&quot;
&quot;Oh!! Sorry dear. You know, I&#39;m a little busy these days. I forgot your birthday. Happy
Birthday Tara.&quot; <br>
She went to Dad to know whether he remembers the birthday. But as he saw her, he
scolded her for not getting ready to go.
Tara was disappointed. It was her first experience to get ignored on a birthday.
Five minutes later, she came down with her red face, fixed herself in the backseat of the car.
By that time Mamma and Dad were smiling and saying something secretly to each other&#39;s
ears. <br>
The Car went smoothly through the highway. None of them said anything. Tara&#39;s eyes were
out the window. She was murmuring something beneath her lovely yellow mask.
A few minutes later she noticed that the car was moving through the wrong road. She asked;
&quot;Dad, where are we going?&quot; <br>
&quot;Just going to the market. I want to pick something and later we could turn to grandpa&#39;s
house&quot;
&quot;You&#39;re lying. Market is not in this route. Tell me the truth. Where are we going&quot;? <br>

Then Mamma solved the argument; &quot;Tara, just keep quiet. Let him drive.&quot;
&quot;But Mom, why can&#39;t you tell me the truth?&quot;
&quot;Tara, please!! You will know it. Now calm down.&quot;
Then Tara understood that they were trying to give her a surprise. Her face turned so happy
and curious to know about their plan. She eagerly waited to reach the destination. Her mind
travelled to a whole new world of her dreams.
Suddenly the car stopped. It was a PET SHOP. <br>
&quot;Mom, Dad, you&#39;re going to get me a pet?&quot;
&quot;Yes dear. Don&#39;t you like pets?&quot; Mamma asked happily.
&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered with a bright face.
&quot;What kind of a pet do you want?&quot; Dad joined the conversation.
&quot;Of course, I need a dog.&quot;
&quot;Then go, select your favourite dog. Let&#39;s see your selection.&quot; Mamma said.
&quot;Mom, Dad you&#39;re the best parents in the world. I love you. I thought you both forgot my
birthday. Sorry.&quot; <br>
Tears were rolling down over her lovely yellow mask.
Mamma hugged her and later joined her to select her dog. She found a lovely white furry
cute little dog at the end of the room. It was making some lovely sounds and waves its tail as
it saw Tara. She fixed it as her dog.
&quot;Dad, I found my dog. I love it.&quot;
&quot;Wow!! Tara, your selection is great. It looks so cute and also, I think he liked you. Look at
the way he waves its tail...and his tongue outside...&quot;
&quot;Yes dad.. I like it.&quot; <br>
Dad went to the counter and paid money. As he returned, Mamma and Tara were talking to
the dog. The dog played cute with them.
&quot;Now it&#39;s time to name him... Any idea??&quot; Mamma asked.
&quot;Can I call him &#39;DODDY&#39;....??&quot; Asked Tara.
&quot;DODDY.....seems interesting...&quot; Dad turned to the dog and asked &quot;DODDY....do you like
this name??&quot; <br>
 <br>
DODDY immediately barked, showing his happiness as he liked the name.
Then, the owner of the pet shop released the dog from the cage. As soon as he opened the
cage, DODDY jumped towards Tara and licked her lovely yellow facemask.
Dad said; &quot;DODDY, Welcome to our family.&quot;
And soon DODDY barked, showing his gratitude.
 <br>
Everyone laughed. <br>
