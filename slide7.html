                    <br>
                    <br>

                    I got a letter from my home. It was written that -&quot;We are coming there within a week&quot;.<br> The
letter was written a week before and the day they spoke out is today. I was really tense and
did not know what to do. Karan was sleeping and as he heard about the letter he jumped up
and started shouting with tension. &#39;Pappa Rambo will reach at any time&#39;. Actually pappa
doesn&#39;t know about our relationship and if he knows, he will shoot both of us. He is an ex-
military, therefore very strict .On the other hand Shikha, that is me, loves a messy life full of
enjoyment.......
Karan and I were busy packing our flat to show pappa that I stay alone in the flat. It was 7:30
AM , a winter Monday morning. We somehow changed the flat&#39;s face, removed everything
related to Karan from the flat, and shifted Karan and his things to Adhil&#39;s flat. <br> I changed my
short clothes and went to prepare some homely food. The doorbell rang and there was
Pappa Rambo. I expected Mom along with him. But he was alone and was free handed. I
couldn&#39;t believe him smoking so harshly after a long time. Pappa seemed so tired and
stressed, I made him get in and gave a cup of tea. I couldn&#39;t understand what happened to
him. Usually he enters like a CBI officer and starts questioning me. But now he keeps a
complete silence that makes me confused. After a while he took a deep breath and said :
&quot;We have a train at 7:30 PM. We should go soon. Have you packed your bags?&quot; Really I
couldn&#39;t understand what he was saying. &#39;BAGS?? WHERE ARE WE GOING??&#39; &quot;Don&#39;t you
get my message&quot; pappa enquired. <br><br>
Actually I haven&#39;t read it properly. The letter started with the message of their arrival. I was
totally tensed with the first line itself and couldn&#39;t read the rest because I had a little time and
a lot to do. I took out the letter from the drawer to find the remaining of the letter. As I was
reading it pappa took it from me and said to pack my bags quickly as we have to catch the
train. I went inside to get my bags ready but still couldn&#39;t find why?!! I saw pappa wiping
tears lying on the sofa. I tensed if mamma!!!! No. Nothing. Just my thinking it is! I consoled
myself. <br>
It was getting evening. I packed all my bags and was ready to go. I asked a five minutes and
went up to Adhil&#39;s flat. Seeing me Karan gets disappointed. He wanted to know why I left ,
the same question that I asked to pappa and got no answer. &quot;Anyway&quot; he said: &quot;Be safe and
please don&#39;t forget to write to me&quot;. &#39;SURE&#39; I said, giving a tight hug and left. Pappa was
waiting down the staircase with my luggage. I called for a taxi and we reached the station.
Waiting in the platform, I asked softly about our travel. Pappa looked me with a little love and
sigh. <br>
<br> He took out the crumbled letter from his pockets and gave it to me. I sat on the stone
bench and started reading it
The letter was written by mamma and it is said that she would come to Mumbai. But
something went wrong. I rushed to pappa. Pappa held my hands and looked at me
miserably. Tears were rolling down his cheeks. I asked: &#39;what happened to Mamma&#39;? I was
about to see pappa crying for the first time. He was such a bold man.
Pappa couldn&#39;t say anything. Whole the way home he seems quiet. As we reached home I
rushed to the bedroom. She was sleeping. I sat near her. She woke suddenly and smiled at
me. I asked : &quot;What happened ?&quot; She smiled at me and gave me a doctor&#39;s description.
<br>
<br>
CANCER result positive. She was suffering from a brain tumor. Last stage and nothing more
can be done.

I couldn&#39;t bear it. But Mamma seems so happy. She said: &quot; I&#39;m not afraid of my death. I&#39;m
happy. Because I don&#39;t want to worry anymore about you. You are going to a safer hand....
Haven&#39;t I written about a boy? They are coming tomorrow. We need to fix the date. I don&#39;t
know how long I will be. It&#39;s getting worse day by day. You should be ready tomorrow. Now
you may go and change your clothes and have something. I don&#39;t feel well. Let me take a
rest.&quot; <br>
<br>
<br>
I was confused. What to do. Should I want to tell her about Karan? If I say that maa will be
upset. But I don&#39;t want to make mamma sad. I couldn&#39;t sleep the whole night. Karan had told
me to write to him as soon as I reached here. But mamma&#39;s condition!!!! Next day, as
expected, the boy and his family arrived. I found out that mamma was very happy. So I
decided if it makes her happy, this is all I want. Because &#39;Mamma was my first love, my first
best friend, everything&#39;. The dates were fixed to the week after the next week.
A week later: Whole the family was busy with the preparation for the function. Clothes and
jewellery were ready. I sat before my table, took a pen and a clean sheet of paper. I need to
write to Karan that I won&#39;t be his anymore... I was definitely not happy while writing about my
wedding.
<br><br><br> But I need to do this for my parents. The letter was wet with my tears. Next day I
went to post it. I placed my wedding invitation also along with it.
Days went on....
Today is the special day of my life. YES. My wedding. All are very happy and hurry with each
work. I have no idea whether he will come or not. He didn&#39;t even respond to the letter.
I was sitting before the mirror, all my sisters were sitting around me, looking at how the
beautician put the bridal make-up on me. Suddenly someone entered the room and made a
cheerful noise &#39;Oh my sweet baby&#39;. That was Karan. He just squeezed my cheeks and made
a wild laugh. He asked: &#39;HAPPY?&#39; I looked into his eyes. He just pushed all the girls out of
the room and made the beautician take a break. CLOSED THE DOOR.<br><br> My face started
growing gloomy. He just wiped my tears and turned me to the mirror and said : &quot; What you
did is right. Now you are a responsible daughter, a daughter who sacrifices her love for her
mother&#39;s happiness.&quot; I looked at him with a small happiness. He shouted:&quot; Today is your
day. <br><br>Chill my girl.&quot; And continued: &quot; Maybe I can&#39;t be your life partner.<br> But surely I can be
your best ever brother. So today is a very important day for us, no more sadness or
sentiments. I came to celebrate your special day and why are you treating me so badly.
Keep a cute smile on your face. Because that attracted me the most in you&quot;. I couldn&#39;t
believe how caring and loving he is!! He made the whole day blissful playing a responsible
brother&#39;s duty. He gave all the blessings for my new life and suddenly I hugged him so tightly
where I thanked him for all the happiest moments he gave me from the day we met to this
day.<br>
<br>
This is my story of a friendship that growed to a relationship and that relationship finally
ended with a selfless, endless love of a brother sisterhood. <br>
