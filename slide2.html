                    <br>
                    <br>

                    This is Nimmi&#39;s story. The story of her success. Not everyone can see the world with a
                    positive attitude. But she had a faith in herself that helped to achieve her goal. Nimmi was
                    not a normal girl. Her world was silent. <br>
                    Born in a middle class family, Nimmi&#39;s childhood was not so happy. Even her parents and
                    neighbours cursed her for being mute. But Nimmi had a strong faith in herself that one day
                    she could make her parents proud of her. Nimmi&#39;s brother and his friends always made fun
                    of her calling &#39;dumb&#39;, &#39;earless&#39;, useless etc.
                    But she never minded them. <br>
                    <br>
                    Her world was full of visuals and touches. She enjoyed nature in her own ways. Drawing was
                    her inborn talent and she had a great passion for it. She had a different hobby of copying
                    everything she saw into a sheet of paper. That’s why there were whole pictures in her school
                    books. Her mother often scolds her for seeing pictures drawn in books she studies.<br>
                    <br>
                    As she grew older, her desire to be an artist grew. She started participating in competitions.
                    None of her family encouraged her talents just because they wanted her to get a job and
                    secure her life. For that they needed her to focus on her studies. But Nimmi was ambitious
                    and wanted to build up her career as an Artist.<br>
                    By her parents&#39; force she joined as a teacher in a disability center. But her mind was always
                    behind her strong wish to become an Artist.
                    When Nimmi was 23, her parents decided to fix her marriage. But she was not interested in
                    it. She wanted to be an Artist. So she tried to cancel all the alliances that her papa brought.
                    Her brother was very angry with her and said that he would kill her if she didn&#39;t agree with
                    the family&#39;s decision. She had no more options.
                    Her marriage was fixed.<br>
                    Nimmi felt like she was dead. She loved her parents and also her dreams. But now,
                    everything is going to end. She texted about her last few weeks to her best friend, Snisha.
                    Snisha was always supportive and wanted to see her successful. Hearing her fate she
                    became so sad.<br>
                    <br>
                    But Snisha never wanted to see her end her life like normal people. So she made a plan and
                    discussed it with Nimmi. Nimmi was so happy to hear it and was always thankful to her best
                    friend.
                    Two weeks before her marriage, she jumped from her house and took a train ticket to
                    Chennai. <br> Snisha&#39;s family welcomed her happily to their guest house. Nimmi had a wonderful
                    experience there. She painted everything she saw there. Snisha&#39;s family had an estate in
                    Chennai, so they used to go there often. There were many workers and therefore Nimmi felt
                    comfortable to stay there. It was away from the town so that no one could find her.<br> 
                    <br> 
                    It was the best place she had ever been for developing her skills. She could touch nature as
                    close as possible. She was really happy there.
                    
                    She started to participate in art exhibitions and competitions and won many prizes. Snisha&#39;s
                    family was always supportive. They helped her a lot in her path to success.
                    Once, A company was very much interested in her works and appointed her as their chief
                    designer. <br>  But she was not satisfied. She worked there for one year and resigned her job.
                    Then she started thinking about business. But it needs a lot of money. So she increased her
                    work, participated more often in exhibitions and competitions. She also joined an institute
                    where she can teach drawing to students. Her dream was an Art Gallery.
                    Three years later her dream was fulfilled. She opened her Art Gallery Successfully. News
                    spread faster and her parents came to know about it.They felt ashamed of themselves. <br> 
                    <br>  They
                    asked sorry for their mistake. But Nimmi was so happy to see them.
                    Her Art Gallery named herself. <br> 
                    &quot;THE GARDEN OF SILENCE&quot; <br> <br>
