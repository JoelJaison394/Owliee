                   Jay Asher's debut novel, '13 Reasons Why', the #1 New York Times and International Bestseller is now a thirteen-part Netflix series. Jay Asher got the idea for '13 Reasons Why' at a museum. While taking an audio tour, he was struck by the eeriness of the voice in his ear-a woman who described exactly what he was looking at, but wasn't there.<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   I personally suggest '13 Reasons Why' to all the teenagers out there. I feel like it's a must-have read novel as it includes all kinds of teenage thoughts.<br>

                   "IF YOU'RE LISTENING,<br>
                   <br>
                   YOU'RE TOO LATE."<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The story is about Hanna Baker's suicide and the 13 reasons why she did it. Before she killed herself, she recorded all 13 reasons and made a list of people to whom she wanted the tapes to be passed. The story begins with Clay Jensen, ninth person in the list, getting her tapes, and he was stealing Tony's Walkman to hear those tapes. Throughout the story, we can feel her presence, the tortures she faced and all of her pain.<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   "I hope you're ready, because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to these tapes, you're one of the reasons why."<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   Hannah showed symptoms of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder and borderline personality disorder which eventually led her to take pills.<br> 
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   "Or maybe I wanted someone to point a finger at me and say, "Hannah. Are you thinking about killing yourself? Please don't do that, Hannah. Please?"<br>
                   <br>
                   But deep down, the truth was that the only person saying that was me. Deep down, those were my words."<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   This story clearly shows how someone's action affects our life so badly. Maybe a small act  of kindness can change someone's life. Because;<br>

                   "You don't know what goes on in any one's life but your own. And when you mess with one part of a person's life, you're not messing with just that part. Unfortunately, you can't be that precise and selective. When you mess with one part of a person's life, you're messing with their entire life."<br>

                   The way she connects stories is simply fantastic. The set of Seven Cassettes with 13 thrilling stories could take us away from reality. It just took two days for me to finish this book. If you're interested in psychological fiction books I assure you're not gonna put it back before finishing. From the bottom of my heart, I LOVED READING THIS NOVEL. Thanks to my best buddy for suggesting this novel and I admit 'This was the best book I read last Summer holiday'.<br>
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   The Book will help you to think about other's behaviors and also to look back on how you treated people. '13 Reasons Why' changed my life and I hope it will change yours too.<br>
