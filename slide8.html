                    <br>
                    Jay and me were childhood friends. We shared everything....the lunch, homework,
                    Impositions, punishments... etc.. As we entered high school we were separated into different
                    classes. That killed me. I barely had friends in the new class. At the same time Jay made a
                    lot of new friends. I wait for the breaks to run to his class.
                    I didn&#39;t like him making new friends and having a lot of fun. I always wanted him with me. <br>
                    Jay
                    was the only friend I had since my childhood. We were neighbors. My parents were too busy
                    with their jobs and hence had no time for me. Alone in the flat with our house maid, life was
                    so boring. At that time Jay&#39;s papa got a transfer and their family moved to our nearby flat. I
                    was just 3 years old at that time. Early in the morning my parents go out for duty, return
                    home so late, and after that daily quarrels. I used to sit in the staircase and keep crying. <br>
                    <br>
                    Hearing the noise, Jay&#39;s papa will come home and talk to my parents. Seeing me crying, Jay
                    used to take me to his room and give his toys and we played, ate and slept in his house.
                    Jay and his family were like my family. They gave me the Love that I didn&#39;t get from my
                    home. We grew up together, went to school together.......we were always together. <br> At the
                    age of 8, my papa and mama got divorced. That made me feel so insecure. My mama and I
                    were left alone in the flat. In school I had no friends other than Jay. I refused to make friends
                    with other students in the class. And therefore, people treated me in a different way. But for
                    me, Jay was my life and never allowed him to have fun with other boys in the class. <br>
                    <br>

                    
                    As we grew up, Jay felt so irritated and disturbing. But he never showed it to me. When we
                    got separate classes, Jay was actually so happy. But I kept on disturbing him entering his
                    class on every break. Jay&#39;s new friends made fun of me, pulled my hair and also started
                    calling me some nicknames. I noticed that Jay kept silent and enjoyed teasing me. I couldn&#39;t
                    really accept it. <br>
                    <br>
                    It felt like avoiding me. He has changed a lot. I shouted at him for not
                    responding to his new friends&#39; attitude. But Jay pushed me out of the class and said: &quot; Get
                    lost. I don&#39;t want you here. Just leave me alone. They are my friends and I&#39;m happy with
                    them and you are just a disturbance. So please get lost. &quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    I went to Jay&#39;s home and told his mother about all these. But she seems quite uninterested.
                    She advised me; &quot; You both are now grown up. You are a girl and he is a boy. You should
                    know the difference. He can&#39;t always be with you. He needs his own type of friends. And You
                    too should have. Stop acting like a kid. It&#39;s time to behave maturely.&quot; <br>

                    I felt so lost. The ones whom I thought were mine, now seem to be none. At that moment I
                    realised that I was just forcing them to love me.
                    All are busy in their own lives. Everyone has their own dreams about their life. I was dumb
                    enough to misunderstand that I was important for someone.
                    But...... think about my side.
                    <br>
                    I was fighting for LOVE throughout my life.
